# A "Bog" Adventure App - Intro to Rails 

| Background |
| :---- |
| A bog is a mire that accumulates peat, a deposit of dead plant materialâ€”often mosses. |

Researchers at your local biology lab are exploring and documenting a series of bogs, and the creatures of interest. Our job is to encourage people in the community to explore the bogs and submit their findings using our web application.

We'll be creating a single model app to demonstrate editing resources.
It's important to get comfortable with the process of starting a new Rails app since you'll be doing that for quite awhile

We've determined we'll need the following:

### Bog Controller

* A controller that manages bog creature

### Bog Model

* A creature model that stores `name` and `description`

### Bog Views

* A page with a form to submit a *new* creature
* A page with a form to edit a *creature* already submitted
* A page to view a list of all *creatures*
* A page to view just one *creature*

### Challenge

* Make a nav bar for navigating to the different *bog views*
* Make a delete button for each *bog creature*
